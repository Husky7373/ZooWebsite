<h1>Welcome to the Polar</h1>
<h2>About the Polar</h2>
<p>The polar is the coldest habitat our zoo, it can get as cold as below 20 degrees Fahrenheit! The animals in this habitat
    have features made for this temperature. In the real world Polar habitats are located at the North Pole and South pole
    of the earth, because these are the only places that stay cold enough all year.

<h2>Animals in the Polar</h2>
<p>The Polar is a perfect place for animals with likings of cold weather. Thats why the polar bear and Narwhal live here.</p>
<h3>Polar Bear</h3>
<p>This bear has thick white fur to stay warm in the polar. Their main food source are seals, which they obtain by waiting at the edge of the ice waiting for a seal to come up to the surface. Sadly, due to climate change, polar bears are having a harder time surviving and getting food.</p>

<h3>Narwhal</h3>
<p>Narwhals are one of the most interesting creatures we know exist due to its unicorn-like tusk on their heads. This tusk is the usually around 9 feet long and weighs around 22 pounds. The narwhal itself usually weighs around 1.5 tons! The interesting part is that no one knows why they have this tusk.</p>
