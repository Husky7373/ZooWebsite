<h2>Animals in the Ocean</h2>
<p>The Ocean is filled with animals that range in size and shape. Seahorses and Great White Sharks are very different in size, but lize in the same habitat.</p>
<h3>Seahorse</h3>

<h3>Great White Shark</h3>
<p>As soon as the great white shark is born, it swims away from its mother as the mother sees the baby shark only as prey. Young sharks eat fish and rays but as it grows older it will eat much bigger sea mammels like sea lions and seals. Great white sharks have an extremely high sense of smell and if it smells blood, it will go straight to it.</p>
