<h1>Welcome to the Rainforest</h1>
<h2>About the Rainforest</h2>
<p>The rainforest is home to many, many different animals, all of wich are extremely different from eachother. They are filled with trees and other plants of all sizes, and are the most green places on Earth. The rainforests on Earth usually have a warmer climate but not too hot.

<h2>Animals in the Rainforest</h2>
<p>The rainforest homes all types of animals, reptiles, mammels, birds, pretty much everything! The rivers are even filled with fish. Some of my favorite rainforest animals are the orangurans and the tree frogs.</p>
<h3>Orangutan</h3>
<p>Orangutans are orange monkeys usually found in Asia, they can walk like people and can live to about half the life time of people. They feed on nuts and bark and other parts of plants and trees. The interesting thing about these monkeys is thhat they build their own beds to sleep in at night time with twigs and leaves and sometimes even build a roof.</p>

<h3>Red-Eyed Tree Frog</h3>
<p>The red-eyed tree frog is a small frog that fits in your palm. With a green body amd red eyes it hops along the soil and plants of the rainforest. Its green body helps it blend in with the environment to protect it from its predators. These little guys feed on even littler guys like insects. These frogs are the final result of an aged tadpole.</p>
