<h1>Welcome to the Desert</h1>
<h2>About the Desert</h2>
<p>Deserts are some of the hottest places on earth and a big portion of California is actually a desert. The hottest temperature ever recorded on earth was actually in California's and Nevada's Death Valley where it reached 134 degrees fahrenheit. Sand dunes make up a large portion of the desert. Although the desert is hot, it is filled with plants and animals.

<h2>Animals in the Desert</h2>
<p>Animals in this area are everywhere but many are smaller and harder to notice. One of the smaller animals in the desert is the Desert Tortoise, and another is the Gila Monster</p>
<h3>Desert Tortoise</h3>
<p>How do animals survive the desert? The desert totise uses their strong arms to dig underground and protect themselves from the heat. Tortoises are very solitary and will fight for dominance by trying to knock eachother over on their backs, if this happens, the tortoise will wiggle itself until he filps back on his stomach.</p>
